## Assignment 1 - https://github.com/MaxCHENGLONG/MMF-HT24/blob/main/Assignment1/Assignment_1_MMFHT24.pdf
The exercise
1, Think of a player who you enjoyed watching at the recent mens Euros 2024 or women's World Cup 2023.
2, What actions did they perform that were important and why?
3, Download data from Statsbomb for the tournamentsLinks to an external site.. Plot the actions and describe how the data supports or contradicts your own analysis.
4, Compare the players (using statistical methods) to other players in the tournament.
5, Write a short text using at most two figures that illustrate your point.
The hand-in should be at most two pages, including figures. Submit one file only.
This is a graded exercise. 8/50 points in the final grade. (plus 2/50 for reviews).
Join the slack groupLinks to an external site. for the course to discuss this exercise.
Post a draft of your exercise to the Slack group on Monday 9th for feedback from Pegah on Wednesday 11th.
The peer reviews
You review 3 of your peers submissions. You should write one or two sentences about each of:

Technical: what are the positive and negative 

Insight: How much insight does this give you in to the player?

Presentation: Are the results intuitive and easy to understand?

Please be positive and constructive in your feedback. I do the grading, you provide useful feedback.

The peer review is a graded exercise. 2/50 points in the final grade.

Please do your peer reviews as promptly as possible, with a deadline on Friday 20th September.

## Assignment 2 - https://github.com/MaxCHENGLONG/MMF-HT24/blob/main/Assignment2/Assignment_2_MMFHT24_Technical_Report_Individual_.pdf
This is a graded exercise. Deadline is strict.

It is summer of 2018. The head scout of your club (the Premier League one which group you are in) is looking to strengthen the squad with a good signing. She is interested in hearing about how statistical models and machine learning can be used to assess players, so she asks you to create a metric to measure an aspect of play. She then wants to know who the best player in the top five clubs in Europe are in this metric.

You should do the following steps:

1, Decide on some aspect of play you would like to measure. This can be an attacking metric — pass success rate, the danger created by a pass, an expected assists or goals model — or a defensive metric — expected threat prevented, a zonal model of defensive value, danger by opposition after a player makes a defensive action. Formulate it as a machine learning problem with input and output variables. Train the model on data from the Premier League and find the top ranking players in that league. Then look in other leagues to find a player who tops the metric.

Write a simple non-technical text explaining your measure to the scout and what assumptions it makes (up to 2 pages).  Then write a more technical text (up to 6 pages) explaining how you created the machine learning model. Submit a Python file for fitting the model on the Premier League. This code should run without error with standard libraries (mplsoccer ok) if put in the same directory as the events_England.json.

Points will be awarded for the novelty of the metric, the clarity of the explanation, the quality and correctness of the code and for the technical difficulty of the contribution. (16 points). 

2, On either the 14th or 16th of October you will present your model and recommendations to the other group members. This presentation should consist of two slides (which you should share with other group members) and be no more than two minutes long. It should be non-technical, so that the scout understands the results from a footballing point of view. And it should come to a recommendation of a player to sign. After the presentations, you will have a group discussion comparing your choices. (4 points)

3, By midnight Sunday 20th October your group should submit a joint report. This should consist of a one paragraph summary of all the metrics presented and recommendations. Additionally, you should also include an data-driven analysis (at most one page) of the needs of the team. Do they need to strengthen in attack or defence and in what area? Finally, you should then recommend at least two signings as a group (group submission, 10 points). 

All group members should submit their own individual report here. Group submissions should be made here.
